        <h1>Team Coordination & Remote Management</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Crisis Campaign Coordination Across International Distributed Team</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>When the company faced urgent revenue targets requiring $100K in sales within 90 days to maintain operational stability, the marketing team needed to coordinate a comprehensive campaign while continuing all regular business operations. The challenge involved managing a distributed team across four countries and multiple time zones, coordinating both internal team members and external vendors, and executing a complex multi-phase campaign under extreme time pressure.</p>

        <p>The team included contractors across the United States from coast to coast, media coordinator in Canada, web and marketing consultant in Australia, plus external creative vendors through the Flocksy platform. Team members had varying comfort levels with collaboration tools, from seasoned executives who preferred traditional communication methods to contractors who needed training on systematic workflow adoption.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Building on previously established coordination systems, I adapted our workflows to meet crisis timeline demands while maintaining team cohesion across multiple time zones and platforms.</p>

        <div class="highlight-section">
            <h4>Strategic Market Research Coordination:</h4>
            <p>Coordinated multi-source intelligence gathering across community analysis (20K member behavioral data), sales team feedback, and direct surveys. Systematically analyzed historical content performance to identify messaging themes that resonated with our military-linked audience. Collaborated with copywriter and CEO to synthesize research into revised campaign messaging targeting beginner contractors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-section">
            <h4>Multi-Platform Campaign Management:</h4>
            <p>Built cause marketing campaign around virtual workshop series, with all proceeds donated to Wounded Warrior Project to resonate with our military-linked audience. Designed tiered pricing structure ($15/$50/$500) to identify high-value prospects and separate them from budget-conscious attendees. Coordinated content creation across email campaigns, social media, sales pages, video ads, and workshop materials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-section">
            <h4>Rapid Content Production Coordination:</h4>
            <p>Pivoted existing podcast schedule to create 5-day series supporting campaign messaging. Coordinated St. Louis video team with Colorado-based founder using established "one-click" studio setup. Managed slide deck production through external Flocksy designers while maintaining brand consistency across multiple program identities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-section">
            <h4>International Team Communication:</h4>
            <p>Shifted from formal Trello project workflows to rapid Slack huddles and Google Docs collaboration to meet crisis timeline demands. Maintained our standard Tuesday late-afternoon marketing huddles to keep the Australia-based team member connected with US operations. Ensured clear communication channels so distributed team members stayed informed regardless of their time zone.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>The campaign required adaptation of established systematic processes to meet compressed timelines while maintaining quality standards. I coordinated the team through a strategic 32-day timeline:</p>

        <p><strong>Phase 1 (April 28-May 11):</strong> Market research and messaging optimization<br>
        <strong>Phase 2 (May 12-19):</strong> Podcast series coordination and production<br>
        <strong>Phase 3 (May 20-22):</strong> Live workshop execution with 90% attendance rate<br>
        <strong>Phase 4 (May 22-30):</strong> Sales conversion and enrollment coordination</p>

        <p>Throughout all phases, I maintained regular operational responsibilities including audio podcast production, guest vetting and selection, social media posting, and community engagement, ensuring business-as-usual operations continued seamlessly alongside crisis campaign execution.</p>

Most importantly, it demonstrated the value of building systematic operational foundations that enable teams to perform exceptionally when business continuity depends on flawless execution.</p>
